## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.


stack and queue both of them are array ,but the main diffrences between them that how we treat (deal) with them

the stack > follow (lifo) rule it means that who first in (adding) it will go outside the last ,and who last in (adding) it will go out the fist .
the real example of this rule in life (washing dishes in kitchen ,the first dish from the bottom it will washes at the end so,first in last out or vise versa last in first out)

the queue> follow (fifo) rule it means that who first in (adding) it will go outside the first ,and who last in (adding) it will go out the last.
the real example of this rule in life (the clients queue in bank ,the first clinet in the queue it will sreves the first so,first in first out or vise versa last in last out)
